# FSATOOL 1.0

[FSATOOL 1.0](https://fsatool.github.io/fsatool) is a useful tool for the conformational sampling and trajectory analysis work for biomolecules. It is developped by Chen Changjun's group in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The tool is a plugin in AMBER software (<http://ambermd.org/>). It contains several enhanced sampling methods, including **replica exchange molecular dynamics** (REMD), **adaptively biased molecular dynamics** (ABMD), **steered molecular dynamics** (SMD), **essential dynamics sampling** (EDS) and **mixing REMD** method. Moreover, it is also able to build the folding network and the dominant transition pathways from the simulation data based on the **Markov state model** (MSM) and the **transition path theory**.
